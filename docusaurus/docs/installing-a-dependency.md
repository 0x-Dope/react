title: Installing a Dependency

The generated project includes React and ReactDOM as dependencies. It also includes a set of scripts used by Create React App as a development dependency. You may install other dependencies (for example, React Router) as we show below:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save react-router-dom
```

This works for any library, not only `react-router-dom`.
