# Remaining

* Not too many commands
* Not too many config files
* Minimize duplication, eg. installing library should not take many steps
* Opening repo in editor should just work
* Doucment how to install dependencies
* Document usual suspects for routing/state/async/fetch: react-router, react-redux, redux-thunk, isomorphic-fetch
* dependency management: npm, unpkg

| Advanced assertions, e.g. Chai  | :grey_question: | :grey_question: | :grey_question: | :grey_question: | :grey_question: | :grey_question: | :grey_question: |
| Mocking ability, e.g. Sinon  | :grey_question: | :grey_question: | :grey_question: | :grey_question: | :grey_question: | :grey_question: | :grey_question: |
