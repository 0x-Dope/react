* Clutter-free
 * Not too many commands
 * Not too many config files
* Minimize duplication, eg. installing library should not take many steps

* Include Typescript declaration of js package which is not available as @type/...
* Opening repo in editor should just work
* Environment flag (production/development) which can be used in code
* Proxy To Backend
* Offline
* Doucment how to install dependencies
* Document usual suspects for routing/state/async/fetch: react-router, react-redux, redux-thunk, isomorphic-fetch
