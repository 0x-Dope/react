# webpack-env-define-plugin

This package includes a webpack plugin used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).  
The plugin grabs environment variables that follows a specified regex and injects them into the application using the 
webpack DefinePlugin.
In addition, the plugin allows defining custom environment variables to be injected.

## Usage in Create React App Projects

See [webpack.config.dev.js](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.dev.js#L200) and [webpack.config.prod.js](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.prod.js#L234).

## Usage Outside of Create React App

If you want to use this webpack plugin in a project not built with Create React App, you can install it with following steps.

First, install this package.

  ```
  npm install --save-dev webpack-env-define-plugin
  ```

Then reference it in your webpack config:

  ```js
  var EnvDefinePlugin = require('../../webpack-env-define-plugin');
  ```

and define it as a plugin in the webpack config plugin section:
 
 ```js
  plugins: [
     ...
     new EnvDefinePlugin({
       // Grab MY_PREFIX_* environment variables
       regex: /^MY_PREFIX_/i,
       customVariables: {
         // Useful for determining whether weâ€™re running in production mode.
         // Most importantly, it switches React into the correct mode.
         'MY_ENV_VAR': JSON.stringify(
           process.env.MY_ENV_VAR || 'default'
         )
       }
     }),
     ...
  ]
 ```
