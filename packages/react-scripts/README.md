# react-scripts-cssmodules

## What is this? 
**Add CSS Modules to `create-react-app` by replacing `react-scripts` with `react-scripts-cssmodules`**

## Instructions
Create a [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) project as usual. Then `npm uninstall --save-dev react-scripts` and `npm install --save-dev react-scripts-cssmodules`. Whenever an update to create-react-app occurs, you can update `react-script-cssmodules` to gain the latest features.

## About
This is a fork for [react-scripts](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/react-scripts) from [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) that adds cssmodules support.

Based on [suggestions by the creators](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/682) of create-react-app. It is kept up to date and versioned along side the official create-react-app. (E.g v0.9.2 of create-react-app / react-scripts will be version v0.9.2 of react-scripts-cssmodules)
