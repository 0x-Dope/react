# eslint-config-react-app

This package includes the shareable ESLint configuration used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Installation

*The easiest way to use this configuration is with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), which includes it by default â€“ you* **don't need to install it separately in Create React App projects.**

If you want to use this ESLint configuration in a project not built with Create React App, you can install it with following steps.

1. Install this package, ESLint and the necessary plugins:

  ```
  npm install eslint-config-react-app babel-eslint@6.1.2 eslint@3.5.0 eslint-plugin-flowtype@2.18.1 eslint-plugin-import@1.12.0 eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y@2.2.2 eslint-plugin-react@5.2.2 --save-dev
  ```

2. Create a file named `.eslintrc` with following contents in the root folder of your project:

  ```
  {
    "extends": "react-app"
  }
  ```

  That's it! You can override the settings from `eslint-config-react-app` by editing the `.eslintrc` file. Learn more about [configuring ESLint](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring) on the ESLint website.
