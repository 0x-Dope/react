    Making a Progressive Web App
  </h1><p>The production build has all the tools necessary to generate a first-class
<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/">Progressive Web App</a>,
but <strong>the offline/cache-first behavior is opt-in only</strong>. By default,
the build process will generate a service worker file, but it will not be
registered, so it will not take control of your production web app.</p>
<p>In order to opt-in to the offline-first behavior, developers should look for the
following in their <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/src/index.js"><code>src/index.js</code></a> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
// Learn more about service workers: http://bit.ly/CRA-PWA
serviceWorker.unregister();</code></pre>
<p>As the comment states, switching <code>serviceWorker.unregister()</code> to
<code>serviceWorker.register()</code> will opt you in to using the service worker.</p>

    Why Opt-in?
  </h2><p>Offline-first Progressive Web Apps are faster and more reliable than traditional web pages, and provide an engaging mobile experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>All static site assets are cached so that your page loads fast on subsequent visits, regardless of network connectivity (such as 2G or 3G). Updates are downloaded in the background.</li>
<li>Your app will work regardless of network state, even if offline. This means your users will be able to use your app at 10,000 feet and on the subway.</li>
<li>On mobile devices, your app can be added directly to the user&#39;s home screen, app icon and all. This eliminates the need for the app store.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, they <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2398">can make debugging deployments more challenging</a> so, starting with Create React App 2, service workers are opt-in.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin"><code>workbox-webpack-plugin</code></a>
is integrated into production configuration,
and it will take care of generating a service worker file that will automatically
precache all of your local assets and keep them up to date as you deploy updates.
The service worker will use a <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-cookbook/#cache-falling-back-to-network">cache-first strategy</a>
for handling all requests for local assets, including
<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/high-performance-loading#first_what_are_navigation_requests">navigation requests</a>
for your HTML, ensuring that your web app is consistently fast, even on a slow
or unreliable network.</p>

    Offline-First Considerations
  </h2><p>If you do decide to opt-in to service worker registration, please take the
following into account:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>After the initial caching is done, the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/lifecycle">service worker lifecycle</a>
controls when updated content ends up being shown to users. In order to guard against
<a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/3613#issuecomment-353467430">race conditions with lazy-loaded content</a>,
the default behavior is to conservatively keep the updated service worker in the &quot;<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/lifecycle#waiting">waiting</a>&quot;
state. This means that users will end up seeing older content until they close (reloading is not
enough) their existing, open tabs. See <a href="https://jeffy.info/2018/10/10/sw-in-c-r-a.html">this blog post</a>
for more details about this behavior.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Users aren&#39;t always familiar with offline-first web apps. It can be useful to
<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-ux#inform_the_user_when_the_app_is_ready_for_offline_consumption">let the user know</a>
when the service worker has finished populating your caches (showing a &quot;This web
app works offline!&quot; message) and also let them know when the service worker has
fetched the latest updates that will be available the next time they load the
page (showing a &quot;New content is available once existing tabs are closed.&quot; message). Showing
these messages is currently left as an exercise to the developer, but as a
starting point, you can make use of the logic included in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/src/serviceWorker.js"><code>src/serviceWorker.js</code></a>, which
demonstrates which service worker lifecycle events to listen for to detect each
scenario, and which as a default, just logs appropriate messages to the
JavaScript console.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Service workers <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers#you_need_https">require HTTPS</a>,
although to facilitate local testing, that policy
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34160509/options-for-testing-service-workers-via-http/34161385#34161385">does not apply to <code>localhost</code></a>.
If your production web server does not support HTTPS, then the service worker
registration will fail, but the rest of your web app will remain functional.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The service worker is only enabled in the <a href="deployment.md">production environment</a>,
e.g. the output of <code>npm run build</code>. It&#39;s recommended that you do not enable an
offline-first service worker in a development environment, as it can lead to
frustration when previously cached assets are used and do not include the latest
changes you&#39;ve made locally.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you <em>need</em> to test your offline-first service worker locally, build
the application (using <code>npm run build</code>) and run a simple http server from your
build directory. After running the build script, <code>create-react-app</code> will give
instructions for one way to test your production build locally and the <a href="deployment.md">deployment instructions</a> have
instructions for using other methods. <em>Be sure to always use an
incognito window to avoid complications with your browser cache.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>By default, the generated service worker file will not intercept or cache any
cross-origin traffic, like HTTP <a href="integrating-with-an-api-backend.md">API requests</a>,
images, or embeds loaded from a different domain.</p>
</li>
</ol>

    Progressive Web App Metadata
  </h2><p>The default configuration includes a web app manifest located at
<a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/public/manifest.json"><code>public/manifest.json</code></a>, that you can customize with
details specific to your web application.</p>
<p>When a user adds a web app to their homescreen using Chrome or Firefox on
Android, the metadata in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/public/manifest.json"><code>manifest.json</code></a> determines what
icons, names, and branding colors to use when the web app is displayed.
<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/">The Web App Manifest guide</a>
provides more context about what each field means, and how your customizations
will affect your users&#39; experience.</p>
<p>Progressive web apps that have been added to the homescreen will load faster and
work offline when there&#39;s an active service worker. That being said, the
metadata from the web app manifest will still be used regardless of whether or
not you opt-in to service worker registration.</p>
