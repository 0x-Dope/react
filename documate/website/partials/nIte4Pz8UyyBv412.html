    Pre-Rendering into Static HTML Files
  </h1><p>If you’re hosting your <code>build</code> with a static hosting provider you can use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-snapshot">react-snapshot</a> or <a href="https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap">react-snap</a> to generate HTML pages for each route, or relative link, in your application. These pages will then seamlessly become active, or “hydrated”, when the JavaScript bundle has loaded.</p>
<p>There are also opportunities to use this outside of static hosting, to take the pressure off the server when generating and caching routes.</p>
<p>The primary benefit of pre-rendering is that you get the core content of each page <em>with</em> the HTML payload—regardless of whether or not your JavaScript bundle successfully downloads. It also increases the likelihood that each route of your application will be picked up by search engines.</p>
